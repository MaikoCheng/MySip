# MySip
This is the official github page of the website for MYSIP. It is a cup that was developed by 6 students from TU/e to help people track their fluid intake and help them remember to drink water.
We want people to be able to live longer (in their homes).
We represent group 271 of the Engineering Design course within TU/e.
